Description
===========
Similar to the Opscode motd-tail cookbook, this cookbook is meant to modify the system greeting you see at login.

Requirements
============
Initially targeted at Ubuntu systems, it looks for /etc/update-motd.d/, but is written to be modular enough that
extension should be straightforward.
